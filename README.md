Budget Allocator 
Ferris Atassi, Jasper Wilson, Benn Oishi

We have created a basic skeleton for how our budget allocator will be implemented. This will help us organize our code early on so there are hopefully less errors and a more readable, optimized product. 
At the moment, all our project is able to do is parse a simple CSV file. In the next iteration, we will add functional code to several of our classes that will implement numerous features.
To compile our program from the command line, navigate to the src file and type: "javac BudgetAllocator.AllocMain.java". Then, "java BudgetAllocator.AllocMain" should run the program. A simple script (script.js) would be:
javac BudgetAllocator.AllocMain.java
java BudgetAllocator.AllocMain
