Budget Allocator 
Ferris Atassi, Jasper Wilson, Benn Oishi

We have created a basic skeleton for how our budget allocator will be implemented. This will help us organize our code early on so there are hopefully less errors and a more readable, optimized product. 
In the next iteration, we will add functional code to several of our classes and have a basic working version. At the moment, there isn't anything practical that can be done with our project, but after the next iteration a very basic version will be able to be run.
To compile our program from the command line, type: "javac BudgetAllocator.java". Then, "java BudgetAllocator" should run the program. A simple script (script.js) would be:
javac BudgetAllocator.java
java BudgetAllocator
