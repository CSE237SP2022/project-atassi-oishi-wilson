Budget Allocator 
Ferris Atassi, Jasper Wilson, Benn Oishi

In this iteration, we made it possible to add, remove, and print budget items from a test file. We attempted to display the budget information in a way that is easily read and understandable.
We intend to add functionality for income in the next iteration. As of now, only budget items are able to be modified. The IncomeItem objects are able to be created, but are not functional as of yet.

To compile our program from the command line, open the terminal/console and navigate to the src file. Type: "javac BudgetAllocator.AllocMain.java". Then, "java BudgetAllocator.AllocMain" should run the program. A simple script (script.js) would be:
javac BudgetAllocator.AllocMain.java
java BudgetAllocator.AllocMain
