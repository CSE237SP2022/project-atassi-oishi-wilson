Budget Allocator 
Ferris Atassi, Jasper Wilson, Benn Oishi

In this iteration, we focused on fleshing out the functionality of our application along with adding more complexity to what we already have. We fixed income items to be represenstations of negative budget items. We refactored much of our code to follow the guidelines mentioned in class and also made sure to get rid of anything that should not be staged in our git repository. We added a feature taking into account priorities for specific budget items to enable user customization when they go over budget and need to remove an item. Our project now correctly does removal, so users are fully able to edit their budget month by month. Also worked on the user story regarding not having everything in main as we refactored it into a new class called menu to make main consist of more method calls than raw code. 

To run code, open project cd into src and run "sh ./script.sh".
